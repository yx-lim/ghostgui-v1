## Documentation Conventions

The public workflow uses these canonical terms:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Orange preview | Temporary unsaved robot pose |
| Preview Path | Validate the transition without saving |
| Keyframe | Committed robot and target state at a time |
| Commit Keyframe | Store the current pose as a keyframe |
| Keyframe interval | Amount of time advanced after a commit |

Keep user-facing documentation task-oriented. Put implementation contracts in
the focused technical pages and historical investigations in `archive/`.
