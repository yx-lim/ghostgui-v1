# Troubleshooting

Start with the section that matches the failure. Include the complete status or
terminal message when reporting a problem.

## Installation And Launch

### The `ghostgui` command is not found

Activate the environment created by the installer.

Linux or macOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If `.venv` does not exist, rerun the platform installer from the repository
root.

### Qt fails to initialize on Linux

Confirm that the packages in `scripts/install_linux.sh` were installed.
Messages about Qt platform plugins commonly indicate missing XCB libraries such
as `libxcb-cursor0`, `libxcb-xinerama0`, `libxcb-xinput0`, or
`libxkbcommon-x11-0`.

### MuJoCo cannot create an OpenGL context

GhostGUI requests desktop OpenGL 2.1 compatibility rendering with a 24-bit
depth buffer. Use the rendering error in **Status** to compare that request
with the context supplied by Qt. Confirm that the machine has working GPU
drivers or a software OpenGL stack. Remote desktops, containers, WSL, and
headless sessions may need separate display and OpenGL configuration.

### Memory rises sharply when the 3D view opens on macOS

Run the timed A/B diagnostic from the repository environment:

```bash
python3 scripts/diagnose_macos_rendering.py --model g1 --seconds 20
```

The harness opens the selected robot twice. The first run uses GhostGUI's
desktop OpenGL compatibility request; the second uses Qt's unmodified default
surface format. Each window closes automatically. It records native resident
memory before and after display-list compilation, the realized OpenGL renderer
and profile, context rebuild count, Retina scale, and physical framebuffer
size. The two detailed `stderr.log` paths and their memory comparison are
printed when it finishes.

Use a larger `--seconds` value if either geometry build is reported as
unfinished. A large one-time compile delta points to driver-side display-list
storage, while a rising sequence of periodic samples or multiple contexts
points to retained resources or context recreation. The diagnostic mode is
opt-in and does not change ordinary launches.

### The passive viewer fails on macOS

MuJoCo passive-viewer scripts must run through `mjpython` on macOS. Recreate
`.venv` with a Python matching the machine's native architecture if `python`,
the environment, and `mjpython` do not agree. The main editor can still run
when `mjpython` is unavailable; only the separate **Simulation** window cannot
be launched.

## Model Loading

### A bundled model cannot be found

Install GhostGUI in editable mode from the cloned repository. The registered
model sources and bundled meshes are loaded from the checkout.

### A mesh cannot be resolved

For imported models, select the directory containing the referenced mesh files
when GhostGUI offers to retry. Preserve filename case on case-sensitive file
systems.

If the model uses ROS `package://` references, select either the package root or
the directory containing the referenced `meshes`, `dae`, or `assets` files.

### A cached model appears stale

The runtime cache is content-addressed, so source, mesh, MuJoCo, and cache-format
changes normally create a new entry. To force regeneration, close GhostGUI and
remove only the relevant entry below:

```text
~/.cache/ghostgui/models/
```

If `GHOSTGUI_CACHE_DIR` is set, inspect that directory instead.

## Editing And IK

### The orange preview moves only partway

The target may be unreachable, near a singularity, outside a joint limit, or
constrained by optional IK tasks. Try a smaller edit, use the all-joints preset,
and disable optional posture, foot-lock, and regularization tasks.

### A keyframe cannot be committed

GhostGUI rejects non-finite qpos values and colliding final poses. Inspect the
**Status** details for the collision pair or numerical error, then adjust the
orange preview.

### Preview Path fails

The final pose may be valid while an intermediate sample violates a joint limit
or collides. Add a closer intermediate keyframe or change the motion around the
obstacle.

### The wrong body moves

Re-check **Target robot frame** after switching models. Logical frames are
model-specific. Use **Advanced target** to inspect the underlying MuJoCo body or
site.

## Timeline And Export

### The orange robot changed but the export did not

The orange robot is temporary. Select **Commit Keyframe** before exporting.

### Generation does not match the intended motion

Check the active frame and keyframe times, then inspect playback. Delete or
update an unintended keyframe and regenerate.

### A CSV is rejected

Confirm the file matches the active model. A qpos file requires exactly
`model.nq` headerless values. A headerless trajectory requires time followed by
that many qpos values on every row, with nondecreasing times.

See [Data Formats](data_formats.md) for the full contracts.

## Reporting A Problem

Include:

- operating system and architecture;
- Python and MuJoCo versions;
- selected robot key;
- the command used to launch GhostGUI;
- the complete terminal and **Status** messages;
- whether the issue occurs with a bundled model;
- minimal model or CSV input when the problem is data-dependent.

For a macOS render-memory report, also attach both `stderr.log` files produced
by `scripts/diagnose_macos_rendering.py`.
