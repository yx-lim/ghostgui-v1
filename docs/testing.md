# Testing

Run automated tests before submitting changes and perform focused GUI checks
for behavior that depends on rendering or interaction.

## Automated Suite

From a checkout, use the isolated runner so local application settings,
projects, caches, and XDG state cannot affect results:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_test_suite.py
```

The suite covers model adapters, IK and collision behavior, timeline semantics,
CSV playback, transaction recovery, cancellation and shutdown, visualization
lifecycles, transform-gizmo math, GUI controls, themes, status handling,
packaging contracts, and trajectory smoothing.

CI runs the complete isolated contracts on Linux, macOS, and Windows. A
separate Linux job repeats the responsive control tests at 200 percent Qt
scaling, while the Xvfb job supplies a real software OpenGL context.

Run documentation validation separately:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_docs.py
python3 scripts/check_architecture.py
```

## Focused Tests

Use a test module while iterating:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_robot_viewer_timeline -v
python3 -m unittest tests.test_advanced_ik -v
python3 -m unittest tests.test_model_resources -v
```

Choose the test that owns the changed contract rather than relying only on a
manual launch.

## Package Smoke Test

Build and inspect a wheel, then install it into a clean environment. Run the
smoke script from outside the checkout so source files cannot mask missing
package data:

```bash
python3 -m pip wheel . --no-deps --no-build-isolation --wheel-dir wheelhouse
python3 scripts/check_wheel.py --require-resources wheelhouse/*.whl
python3 -m venv /tmp/ghostgui-wheel-smoke
/tmp/ghostgui-wheel-smoke/bin/python -m pip install wheelhouse/*.whl
cd /tmp
/tmp/ghostgui-wheel-smoke/bin/python \
  /path/to/ghostgui/scripts/smoke_installed_package.py --load-model --gui
```

The smoke gate verifies the console and GUI entry points, the installed MuJoCo
viewer-process module, all registered model sources, theme and documentation
resources, G1 compilation, writable default project storage, visualization
startup, and clean GUI shutdown.

## Headless And Visual Gates

The regular suite uses Qt's offscreen platform. CI additionally starts an Xvfb
display with Mesa software OpenGL and runs:

```bash
GHOSTGUI_VISUAL_TESTS=1 QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb \
  python3 -m unittest tests.test_visual_smoke -v
```

That test requires a valid OpenGL context, captures the composed window, checks
that it is nonblank and opaque, and compares stable toolbar, tab, and sidebar
structure. It skips outside the explicitly configured visual environment.

## macOS Render-Memory Comparison

When a macOS launch consumes unexpectedly high native memory, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/diagnose_macos_rendering.py --model g1 --seconds 20
```

This is a manual diagnostic rather than a CI performance threshold. It runs
the compatibility and Qt-default OpenGL modes in separate processes and state
directories, then reports peak resident memory and display-list compilation
deltas. Both windows close automatically. Retain the printed output directory
because its logs include the realized GPU profile, Retina framebuffer size,
and periodic memory samples needed to interpret the comparison.

## Manual GUI Checks

### Shared Workflow

- Start GhostGUI and confirm the selected model renders.
- Edit an end effector and confirm only the orange preview moves.
- Use **Preview Path** and confirm no keyframe is created.
- Use **Commit Keyframe** and confirm the timeline advances by the configured
  keyframe interval.
- Edit another time and confirm the earlier keyframe remains unchanged.
- Generate, play, pause, scrub, and export the trajectory.
- Confirm preview opacity does not make the application window transparent.
- Confirm reset affects the active time only.

### Model Checks

- **G1:** confirm humanoid hand, foot, torso, and pelvis targets and detailed
  geometry.
- **Go2:** confirm twelve scalar leg joints, four foot targets, the ground, and
  COLLADA-derived visual geometry.
- **H2:** confirm the humanoid targets and bundled STL visuals.
- **Z1:** confirm base, wrist, and tool targets and six arm joints.
- Switch away from a model and back; confirm its editor session is preserved.

### Import And Export

- Load a qpos file with the correct active-model width.
- Reject a qpos or trajectory with the wrong width or non-finite values.
- Export a committed pose and confirm an uncommitted orange preview is absent.
- Import a model with relative meshes.
- Exercise the mesh-folder retry path for an unresolved model asset.

### Path Independence

Launch the compatibility script from a different working directory:

```bash
cd /tmp
python3 /path/to/ghostgui/scripts/run_gui.py --model go2
```

Registry and model paths should remain anchored to the checkout.

## Documentation Checks

Documentation validation should reject:

- broken relative links;
- missing linked files or anchors;
- more than one level-one heading per public page;
- legacy user-facing workflow terminology;
- undocumented public pages;
- trailing whitespace.
